## React Native FlatList rendering issue with dynamic data

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native applications where the FlatList component fails to render items correctly when data is fetched dynamically from an API.  The problem arises because the component doesn't efficiently re-render when the data changes. The solution implements data comparison to trigger a re-render only when necessary, ensuring smooth and accurate display of data fetched from external sources. 

The bug is reproduced in `DataFetchBug.js` and the solution is provided in `DataFetchSolution.js`.
